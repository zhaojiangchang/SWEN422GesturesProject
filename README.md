# SWEN422GesturesProject
mission is to develop a simple software system whose user interface has been specifically designed to make use of the type of multi-finger gestures supported by a LeapMotion. This is similar to designing for multi-touch, although LeapMotion gestures can be in 3D unlike typical multi-touch gestures on 2D surfaces. 
The overall purpose of the project is to firstly demonstrate the LeapMotion, and secondly describe an experiment /study that would assess the usefulness of the tool.
